# C Program Examples

To run this programm is important to have a C compiler. For the course, I recommend to use Visual Studio Code as an IDE for editing and compiling C code. For running a C program in VSCode you should:
- Install VSCode (you can download in the following [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- Download the C/C++ Extension. It is an extension provided by Microsoft that support visual studio code. It helps in IntelliSence, debugging and code browsing of the programming code in the visual studio.

- Download the C/C++ compilers. There are some popular compilers are:
  - GCC on Linux
  - GCC via Mingw-w64 on Windows ([link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw))
  - Clang for XCode on MacOS
